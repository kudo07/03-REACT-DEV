|-- components/ # Reusable components (e.g., PostCard, Loader, ErrorMessage)
|-- services/ # API calls (e.g., fetchPosts.js)
|-- hooks/ # Custom hooks (e.g., useFetch.js for fetching data)
|-- pages/ # Main pages (e.g., PostsPage.js)
|-- App.js # Entry point of the application
|-- index.js # ReactDOM render file
