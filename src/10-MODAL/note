The issue occurs because of event bubbling and timing in the event listener execution.

Why mousedown works but click doesn't?
When using click:

The click event on the "Show Modal" button triggers setIsOpen(true), rendering the modal.
After this, the click event listener on document fires.
Since the modal is now present, the document click handler checks if the click happened outside (!modalRef.current.contains(event.target)).
However, the click originated from the button, and the modal didn't exist at the exact moment the event started.
Result: The modal opens but instantly closes due to the event propagation.
When using mousedown:

The mousedown event fires before the button click.
At this moment, the modal is not yet present, so the document event doesn't trigger closing logic.
The button's onClick fires next, setting isOpen to true and rendering the modal.
Result: The modal stays open properly.
Solution
Use mousedown instead of click for detecting outside clicks, or use stopPropagation() in the button click to prevent the event from bubbling up immediately.
